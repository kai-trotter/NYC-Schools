# Exploring NYC Public School Test Result Scores
![alt text](schoolbus.jpg)

Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.

Analyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend.

I have been provided with a dataset called schools.csv, which is previewed below.

I have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.

# 1. Which NYC schools have the best math results?

To answer this question, I started with a quick calculation. The best math score is typically at least 80% of the maximum possible score of 800, which means an average of 640 or higher is needed to be considered one of the best schools. Based on this, I found that Stuyvesant High School stood out as the top school for math, with an impressive average score of 754.

# 2. What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?

To answer this question I first calculated the total SAT score per school. After calculating the total I sorted them in descending order to get the top 10 schools. Again, Stuyvesant High School came out on top as the highest performing school.

# 3. Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?

It appears that Manhattan had the largest standard deviation of 230.29. To give a more well rounded answer I included the average SAT score and the number of schools in each borough.
